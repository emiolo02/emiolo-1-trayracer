# Trayracer

Really really poorly written (by design) raytracer for use as a worst case scenario within programming courses.

## Build instructions

Windows:

* You can either generate visual studio solution by using CMake, or just open the folder within VSCode and build/run.

Linux:

* Untested, but should run with CMake and possibly even via VSCode.

If you have problems with missing libraries, install (sudo apt-get install ...):
* libgl-dev
* xorg-dev
* libglu1-mesa-dev
* gdb

VSCode requires the C/C++ extension to be able to use the debugger.
